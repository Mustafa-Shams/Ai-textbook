2.  **ROS 2 Essentials**: Architecture, nodes, topics, services, TF, and minimal hands-on examples.
3.  **Digital Twin Simulation**: Gazebo/Isaac Sim workflow, world files, and the importance of simulation.
4.  **VLA + Capstone Pipeline**: A high-level overview of Vision-Language-Action models and building a simple end-to-end robotics pipeline.
